## Homestead Studios

A mock interior design site developed at Fullstack Academy by [Manny Garcia](https://github.com/mannyxgarcia). It was intended to experiment with new technologies not taught at Fullstack.

`Backend` - Firebase, Google Cloud Functions

`Frontend` - React (react hooks only!)

`Style` - Material UI

`Deployment` - Firebase Deployment

`Deployed Link`: https://stackathon-project.firebaseapp.com/

## The Learning Curve

The stack taught at Fullstack Academy is react, redux, node.js, express, and sequelize. Stackathon was my opportunity to explore different ways and methods of building an app. So what are my thoughts on these technologies?....

`React (React Hooks)`

Wow! This is truly the future of React. ‚ú®React Hooks!‚ú® No class functions?? no componentDidMount?? No redux?? Managing state has never been so flexible! It was a rough start at first switching over my way prior way of managing state, but it all came together in my Projects section. I was able to create some beautiful and seamless transitions from adding, deleting, viewing, and paginating through images. Of course this also worked stunningly well with Material UI. There has never been a more perfect match üíç.

`Material Ui`

I gotta be honest, I hated it at first. I almost abandoned this library multiple times throughout the process. Material UI has a custom theme that is simple to use, but of course I decided to go straight for the customizable more complex features. I'm so happy I stuck it out. Material UI manages it's components using react hooks and once I got the a hang of the flow for customization and hooks, the rest was ...well beautiful.

`Google Cloud Functions & Node Mailer`

I wanted to create a functioning contact us page that would easily send emails. Google cloud functions is great for this type of thing! I set up the function to email me directly, hooked it up with node mailer...and Tada! a functioning contact form.
